# TODOS

This is my implementation of a TODO list.
Rather than one just list, they can be created on demand to include many projects.
Speciall care has been put for input confortable user input. Some of the most relevant features in that cornern include:
1. Text highligthing, for quick update.
2. The intro key allows to move to the new task input.
